/*
  # Implement SECURITY INVOKER for all remaining views

  1. Security Changes
    - Convert all remaining SECURITY DEFINER views to SECURITY INVOKER
    - Ensure proper RLS policies are in place for underlying tables
    - Remove private schema dependencies and SECURITY DEFINER functions

  2. Views Updated
    - v_scheduler_dashboard
    - v_import_stats  
    - v_daily_suspicion
    - v_player_file_statistics (if not already updated)

  3. RLS Policy Enforcement
    - All views will respect the querying user's permissions
    - Admin users see all data through RLS policies
    - Regular users see only their authorized data
    - Service role maintains full access

  4. Security Benefits
    - No function-based bypasses of RLS policies
    - Consistent access control across all interfaces
    - Transparent permission model for auditing
